This is a Python script by the name of Polynomial that constructs a Lagrange polynomial and a Cubic Spline from the data generated by the function f(x) = e^x + 2^−x + 2 cos x − 6 in the interval [−2, 2] . The function can be changed within the script.

Lagrange and Cubic Spline refer to the two methods of interpolation based on a given set of points. These two scripts are called in the Polynomial file.

WORKING
- An arbitray value of 'n' data points were used for this code
- In addition to the two algorithms mentioned above, a Newton's divided differences stable was also generated.
- The Polynomial file calls the two scripts and plots comparison graphs of the results.
