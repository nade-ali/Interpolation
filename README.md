This is a Python script by the name of Polynomial that constructs a Lagrange polynomial and a Cubic Spline from the data generated by the function f(x) = e^x + 2^−x + 2 cos x − 6 in the interval [−2, 2] . 

Construct two separate
functions: Lagrange.m for Lagrange polynomial and CubicSpline.m for Cubic Spline
and call them in the Polynomial.m. Further details of the code are given below.
1. Use  and generate data at
n = 10 equally spaced values to be used in Lagrange.m and CubicSpline.m. Your
code should work for any value of n.
2. Generate a data file by the name of DividedDiff.txt which contains properly
spaced/organized Newton’s Divided Difference Table related to the data obtained
in point 1.
3. Perform all calculations related to the Lagrange polynomial and Cubic Spline in
Lagrange.m and CubicSpline.m respectively. Additionally, for Cubic Spline use
natural boundary conditions.
4. Subdivide a graph window into four windows where first three windows show
graph of f, Lagrange polynomial and Cubic Spline respectively, whereas forth
window plots all 3 graph together for comparison purpose.
5. Take 100 data points in [−2, 2] to plot f, Lagrange polynomial and Cubic Spline
in point 4.
6. When graphing, use appropriate colors, markers, legends, etc to differentiate between various graphs.
